Watchman is a web service for monitoring other webservices.

After install add this to your crontab, but replace WORKINGDIR and customize as appropriate
  */5 * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm jruby && cd WORKINGDIR/watchman && rake --silent RAILS_ENV=production monitor >> /tmp/watchman.log  2>&1'

JRuby is required because Watchman depends on HTMLUnit to do the testing.
